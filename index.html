<h2>My Profile</h2>
<h3>IT Assignment 1 Mun Kit (Sam) Choo | S3899850 | Bachelor of IT | 28/03/21</h3>

<div class="row_1">

<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>My name is Sam (Mun Kit) Choo, my student number is s3899850 with the corresponding email s3899850@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Malaysia and very poorly speak Cantonese however have since then moved to Australia at the age of 1 with my Dad, mum and older sister who also was enrolled in RMIT. Since then, I have become an Australian citizen, successfully graduated year 12 and am currently enrolled in Bachelors of IT at RMIT or BP162. An interesting fact about myself is that I like to study other languages and have been and plan to continue studying Japanese which I have been doing since Year 7.</p>

<h2>INTEREST IN IT</h2>

<p>My interest in IT started back when I was 12 and I got my first laptop. I gradually started getting hooked on video games like TF2 at first then League of Legends through YouTube. What hooked me onto games in general was not only the enjoyment factor of the games but also the thought that someone produced this using programming. I have also developed a liking to the hardware side of things particularly computer building also because of YouTube and in general I enjoy the hands-on aspect of it and because of this I have built my own computer. <br>
I chose to come to RMIT mainly because that it is ranked in the top 10 universities for computer science and IT, close to the heart of the city and because my sister also enrolled in RMIT. Before enrolling in BP162 I have had experience in programming through year 12 ‘Software Development’, although it was not a prerequisite for this course, I wanted to at least get a feel for what programming or IT in general was going to be about. <br>
During my three years here at RMIT I expect to learn how to do more in depth programming to solve more complicated needs of current or future clients, how to manage large quantities of data into a database, how to network and how to manage and oversee computer hardware and software.</p>

  <h2>IDEAL JOB</h2>

  <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51723592?type=standard#searchRequestToken=364c99f7-3fc2-453a-af28-df6cda78fb59"target="_blank">Link advertisement</a>
    </p>

<p>This job is all about maintaining, monitoring and troubleshooting devices and systems including hardware and software for the specified company so that systems are ready to use for other users to do work on. This job is appealing to me as I enjoy problem solving and prefer working in a team to solve problems.
The skills, qualifications and experience required for the job are as follows: </p>
<p class="p_list">
-	Ability to analyse and document business requirements/improvement opportunities. <br>
-	End to End Project management skills <br>
-	IP Networking (firewall & router configuration/patching) <br>
-	Microsoft 365/Office experience & administration <br>
-	Awareness of ICT Cyber security risk and compliance assessments <br>
-	Hospitality experience highly desirable <br>
-	Driver’s license and car <br>
</p>
<p>The skills that I currently possess right are a basic understanding in maybe 1 or 2 topics however I will be able to possibly gain a better understanding of these skills through certain major and minor streams specifically in networking, project management and cyber security at the end of my three years in this course. </p>

<h2>PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>
<p>These results show that I am a predominately visual learner which can boost my understanding of how networks work and from the Myer Briggs test, virtuosos explore ideas through troubleshooting, a good skill needed for an IT support technician. Virtuosos also enjoy having other people take an interest in their projects and enjoy lending a hand another good trait needed for the job. However due to my introverted nature it would be initially hard to form a team when working in group tasks so I will need to take the initiative in order to find a team to work with.</p>

<h2>PROJECT IDEA</h2>

<p>The project idea is a fingerprint-based ATM system, where instead of using a card to access your account the user will only need to use their own fingerprint to gain authorization and be able to conduct transactions, withdrawals, etc. This application will store the user’s fingerprint to their corresponding card in a database making it much simpler and less stressful if in the worst-case scenario, you do lose your card all the user will need to provide their fingerprint. <br>
Owning and carrying a credit/bank card is a must need for those transitioning to adulthood, but to abruptly lose this vital item important for daily life can potentially hinder their completion of daily tasks. This project will prove useful as the most common type of identity theft reported in 2019 is credit card theft. By implementing this new fingerprint-based system using python in conjunction with MySQL to store fingerprints this will be a cheap solution to the ongoing problem of identity theft. <br>

<h2>MAIN FEATURES</h2>
<p>The main feature of this project is when users are creating a new or existing credit/debit card account they would be informed to assign their fingerprint to the corresponding account(s) using a fingerprint scanner. The fingerprint with the assigned account would then be transferred into a database containing all the user’s potential data like what type of card, current savings, name, card number, personal email etc. The database filled with accounts will then be connected with all the current and future ATMs via a server hosted by the company which will receive live changes whenever a change is made to any account. For a user to access their account they would first need to go to a local atm owned by the company they would then to scan their fingerprint and for extra safety a 4-digit pin, this will give the user authorisation and send them to the card selection page which they can select their desired card if their fingerprint is bound to multiple accounts. When the desired card is selected, they will then be sent to the options page where there will be several classic features like withdrawal, deposit balance inquiry, print statement, payments etc, but there will also be two new features added like print statement to email, varying note denominations. The print statement to email simple means that when choosing the option to print a statement the user can either choose to print a receipt or directly email it to their account’s set email address. The varying note denominations means that instead of only printing out 50-dollar notes for withdrawals over $100 the user can choose which note denomination they would want to print out, however this option will be capped to stop users from withdrawing fifty, five-dollar notes for a total of $250. <br>

To run this application the given computer will need to have any python code editor program installed and the database management system MySQL installed as well to contain the data. The company investing in this project will also need a server to store, send and receive data, preferable on that matches the number of users they currently have. On top of that atm’s may need to be replaced or modified to suit the new needs of the project.<br>

The main software will need to be written by an experienced programmer as they are dealing with user’s money and there will be severe repercussions if there are any mistakes present in the code. To find the needed programmer several job advertisements can be set up to seek the suited person(s).<br>

If the project is successful the finger-print atm feature will gradually gain more recognition and become more mainstream and with that see the general decline of people carrying around bank cards and therefore, see the overall decline of identity theft in the form of credit card fraud.</p>
